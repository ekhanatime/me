# Global Kindness Network Platform

## Vision
We want to create a global, web-based community where players earn a unique [Me#X] identity, help each other solve problems, rate the quality of that help, and visually see these connections on a world map. Through achievements, badges, team challenges, and daily/weekly quests, we aim to foster a sense of progress, collaboration, and recognition for users who consistently help others.

## Core Features

### 1. Identity & Progression System
- Unique [Me#X] identifiers for all users
- XP system based on help given and ratings received
- Badges for Helper Milestones (1, 5, 10, 50, 100+ helps)
- Skill-based Mastery badges for domain excellence

### 2. Collaborative Ecosystem
- Group formation with regional/skill-based clustering
- Team challenges with shared objectives
- Global Help-a-thon events with live leaderboards

### 3. Global Visualization
- Interactive world map showing help connections
- Heatmaps of activity hotspots
- Regional leaderboards to drive engagement
