# Action Plan & Thought Log

## Core Concept (2025-02-06)
**Viral Help Network**  
Players (Me#X) form branching connections through acts of help â†’ Visualized as
- Dynamic tree diagrams (D3.js)
- Geospatial connections (Mapbox)
- Legacy score tracking

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. [ ] User registration system
2. [ ] Basic help transaction flow
3. [ ] Star rating implementation

### Phase 2: Viral Mechanics
1. [ ] Help chain tracking
2. [ ] Network value algorithms
3. [ ] Exponential growth incentives

### Current Phase: MVP Development
- [X] Implement core user profile
- [X] Create skill database structure
- [ ] Develop help request system
- [ ] Build interactive map prototype

## Decision Log

### 2025-02-06: Tech Stack Choice
```
Rationale: Chose React/Mapbox over Google Earth:
- Better custom visualization control
- No third-party map styling restrictions
- Cost-effective at scale
